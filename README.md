# OOPJ Course Programs Repository

Welcome to the **Object-Oriented Programming in Java (OOPJ)** repository! This repository contains Java programs that demonstrate various OOPJ concepts, following the **MU OOPJ course** syllabus. Each program is structured to help students understand and implement essential OOP principles and Java features.

## 1. Basic Programming Constructs: Branching and Looping

This program covers the fundamental programming constructs in Java:
- **Branching**: If-else, switch-case
- **Looping**: For, while, do-while

**File**: `Experiment no.1.java`

## 2. Accepting Input Using Scanner and BufferedReader

This program demonstrates how to accept input from the user using:
- **Scanner**: A simpler way to handle input.
- **BufferedReader**: More efficient for large inputs.

**File**: `Experiment no.2.java`

## 3. Class and Objects Demonstration

Learn how to define classes, create objects, and interact with their members in this example.

**File**: `Experiment no.3.java`

## 4. Method and Constructor Overloading

This program shows how to implement **method overloading** and **constructor overloading** in Java.

**File**: `Experiment no.4.java`

## 5. Packages in Java

Learn how to create and use **packages** in Java to organize classes and avoid naming conflicts.

**File**: `Experiment no.5.java`

## 6. 2D Arrays and String Functions

This program demonstrates:
- **2D Arrays**: Working with multi-dimensional data structures.
- **String Functions**: Basic string manipulations like concatenation, comparison, and substring.

**File**: `Experiment no.6.java`

## 7. Super and Final Keywords in Java

Understand how to use:
- **Super Keyword**: To call parent class methods and constructors.
- **Final Keyword**: To prevent method overriding or inheritance, or to declare constants.

**File**: `Experiment no.7.java`

## 8. Single Inheritance with Interface

This program demonstrates **Single Inheritance** and how Java implements the **Interface** mechanism to achieve multiple inheritance-like behavior.

**File**: `Experiment no.8.java`
